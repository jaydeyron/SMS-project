**Stock Management System**

The stock management system aims at automating the stock management activities in the shop. The shop owner can keep a record of all
the items available in the shop. He has the authority to add, delete and modify the items in the record. This record will be automatically
updated on every purchase made. The shop owner can view the record any time for stock verification. The system also provides the
facility for automatic stock report generation of weekly activities. This system will help to reduce the time and cost of stock management
